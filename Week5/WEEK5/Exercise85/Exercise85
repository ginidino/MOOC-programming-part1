Exercise 85 is about Reformatory and is divided into 3 part
  * In this assignment, we use the already given class Person and are supposed to build a new class Reformatory. 
    Reformatory objects do certain things to persons, e.g. measure their weight and feed them.
  * Note: you should not alter the code in the class Person!

Exercise 85.1 is about Weight of a person
  * The reformatory class already has a method skeleton public int weight(Person person):

    public class Reformatory {

        public int weight(Person person) {
          // returns the weight of the parameter
          return -1;
        }
    }
  
  * The method gets a person object as a parameter. The method is supposed to return the weight of the parameter, 
    so the method should call a suitable method of person, get the return value and then return it to the caller.

  * In the following a reformatory weight's two persons:

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Reformatory eastHelsinkiReformatory = new Reformatory();

        Person brian = new Person("Brian", 1, 110, 7);
        Person pekka = new Person("Pekka", 33, 176, 85);

        System.out.println(brian.getName() + " weight: " + eastHelsinkiReformatory.weight(brian) + " kilos");
        System.out.println(pekka.getName() + " weight: " + eastHelsinkiReformatory.weight(pekka) + " kilos");
    }
  
  * The output should be:
    Brian weight: 7 kilos
    Pekka weight: 85 kilos
  
Exercise 85.2 is about Feeding a person
  * In the previous part of the assignment, the method weight queried some information from the parameter object by calling its method. 
    It is also possible to change the state of the parameter. 
    Add to class Reformatory the method public void feed(Person person) that increases the weight of its parameter by one.

  * Next, an example where first the weight of Pekka and Brian is measured and printed. 
    Then Reformatory feeds Brian three times and after that the weights are measured and printed again.

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Reformatory eastHelsinkiReformatory = new Reformatory();

        Person brian = new Person("Brian", 1, 110, 7);
        Person pekka = new Person("Pekka", 33, 176, 85);

        System.out.println(brian.getName() + " weight: " + eastHelsinkiReformatory.weight(brian) + " kilos");
        System.out.println(pekka.getName() + " weight: " + eastHelsinkiReformatory.weight(pekka) + " kilos");

        eastHelsinkiReformatory.feed(brian);
        eastHelsinkiReformatory.feed(brian);
        eastHelsinkiReformatory.feed(brian);

        System.out.println("");

        System.out.println(brian.getName() + " weight: " + eastHelsinkiReformatory.weight(brian) + " kilos");
        System.out.println(pekka.getName() + " weight: " + eastHelsinkiReformatory.weight(pekka) + " kilos");
    }
  
  * The output should reveal that Brian has gained 3 kilos:
    Brian weight: 7 kilos
    Pekka weight: 85 kilos

    Brian weight: 10 kilos
    Pekka weight: 85 kilos
  
Exercise 85.3 is about Number of times a weight has been measured
  * Add to class Reformatory the method public int totalWeightsMeasured() that returns the total number of times a weight has been measured.
  * With the following main program:

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Reformatory eastHelsinkiReformatory = new Reformatory();

        Person brian = new Person("Brian", 1, 110, 7);
        Person pekka = new Person("Pekka", 33, 176, 85);

        System.out.println("total weights measured "+eastHelsinkiReformatory.totalWeightsMeasured());

        eastHelsinkiReformatory.weight(brian);
        eastHelsinkiReformatory.weight(pekka);

        System.out.println("total weights measured "+eastHelsinkiReformatory.totalWeightsMeasured());

        eastHelsinkiReformatory.weight(brian);
        eastHelsinkiReformatory.weight(brian);
        eastHelsinkiReformatory.weight(brian);
        eastHelsinkiReformatory.weight(brian);

        System.out.println("total weights measured "+eastHelsinkiReformatory.totalWeightsMeasured());
    }
  
  * the output should be:
    total weights measured 0
    total weights measured 2
    total weights measured 6
