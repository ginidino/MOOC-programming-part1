Exercise77 is about Lyyra-card and is divided into 6 part
  * In this assignment, we implement the class LyyraCard that simulates the Lyyra card.

Exercise 77.1 is about Class skeleton
  * Start by adding the class LyyraCard to your project.
  * Then implement the LyyraCard constructor that gets the starting balance of the card as parameter. 
    The card saves the balance in the object variable balance. Implement also the toString method that returns a string of the form "The card has X euros".

  * The skeleton of class LyyraCard looks like this:

    public class LyyraCard {
        private double balance;

        public LyyraCard(double balanceAtStart) {
            // write code here
        }

        public String toString() {
            // write code here
        }
    }
    
  * The following main program can be used to test the program:

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            LyyraCard card = new LyyraCard(50);
            System.out.println(card);
        }
    }
    
  * The output should be:
    The card has 50.0 euros
    
Exercise 77.2 is about Paying with card
  * Implement the following methods to LyyraCard:

    public void payEconomical() {
        // write code here
    }

    public void payGourmet() {
        // write code here
    }
    
  * Method payEconomical should decrease the balance by 2.50 euros and method payGourmet by 4.00 euros.

  * The following main program can be used to test the program:

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            LyyraCard card = new LyyraCard(50);
            System.out.println(card);

            card.payEconomical();
            System.out.println(card);

            card.payGourmet();
            card.payEconomical();
            System.out.println(card);
        }
    }
    
  * The output should be:
    The card has 50.0 euros
    The card has 47.5 euros
    The card has 41.0 euros
    
Exercise 77.3 is about Balance nonnegative
  * Change methods payEconomical and payGourmet so that if there is not enought money, the balance does not change.

  * The following main program can be used to test the program:

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            LyyraCard card = new LyyraCard(5);
            System.out.println(card);

            card.payGourmet();
            System.out.println(card);

            card.payGourmet();
            System.out.println(card);
        }
    }
    
  * The output should be:
    The card has 5.0 euros
    The card has 1.0 euros
    The card has 1.0 euros
    
  * Above, the second call payGourmet does not alter the balance since there is not enough money on the card for a gourmet lunch.

Exercise 77.4 is about Loading money to card
  * Add the LyyraCard the following method:

    public void loadMoney(double amount) {
        // write code here
    }
    
  * The method should increase the balance of the card by the given amount. However, the maximum balance on a card is 150 euros. 
    In case the balance after loading money would be more than that, it should be truncated to 150 euros.

  * The following main program can be used to test the program:

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            LyyraCard card = new LyyraCard(10);
            System.out.println(card);

            card.loadMoney(15);
            System.out.println(card);

            card.loadMoney(10);
            System.out.println(card);

            card.loadMoney(200);
            System.out.println(card);
        }
    }
    
  * The output should be:
    The card has 10.0 euros
    The card has 25.0 euros
    The card has 35.0 euros
    The card has 150.0 euros
    
Exercise 77.5 is about Loading a negative amount
  * Change the method loadMoney so that the balance of the card does not change if the amount to load is negative.

  * The following main program can be used to test the program:

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            LyyraCard card = new LyyraCard(10);
            System.out.println("Pekka: " + card);
            card.loadMoney(-15);
            System.out.println("Pekka: " + card);
        }
    }
    
  * The output should be:
    Pekka: The card has 10.0 euros
    Pekka: The card has 10.0 euros
    
Exercise 77.6 is about Multiple cards
  * Write a main method that does the following:

    - Creates a LyyraCard for Pekka with initial balance of 20 euros
    - Creates a LyyraCard for Brian with initial balance of 30 euros
    - Pekka buys gourmet lunch
    - Brian buys economical lunch
    - cards are printed (both on their own row, starting with the name of the card owner)
    - Pekka loads 20 euros
    - Brian buys gourmet lunch
    - cards are printed (both on their own row, starting with the name of the card owner)
    - Pekka buys economical lunch
    - Pekka buys economical lunch
    - Brian loads 50 euros
    - cards are printed (both on their own row, starting with the name of the card owner)
    
  * The main skeleton is as follows:

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            LyyraCard cardPekka = new LyyraCard(20);
            LyyraCard cardBrian = new LyyraCard(30);

            // write code here
        }
    }
    
  * The output should be:
    Pekka: The card has 16.0 euros
    Brian: The card has 27.5 euros
    Pekka: The card has 36.0 euros
    Brian: The card has 23.5 euros
    Pekka: The card has 31.0 euros
    Brian: The card has 73.5 euros
