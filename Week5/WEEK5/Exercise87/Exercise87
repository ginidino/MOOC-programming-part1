Exercise 87 is about Apartment comparison and is divided into 3 part
  * The information system of a Housing service represents the apartments it has for sale using objects of the following class:

    public class Apartment {
        private int rooms;
        private int squareMeters;
        private int pricePerSquareMeter;

        public Apartment(int rooms, int squareMeters, int pricePerSquareMeter){
            this.rooms = rooms;
            this.squareMeters = squareMeters;
            this.pricePerSquareMeter = pricePerSquareMeter;
        }
    }
  
  * Next you should implement a couple of methods that help in apartment comparisons.

Exercise 87.1 is about Larger
  * Implement the method public boolean larger(Apartment otherApartment) that returns true 
    if the Apartment object for which the method is called (this) is larger than the apartment object given as parameter (otherApartment).

  * Example of the usage:

    Apartment studioManhattan = new Apartment(1, 16, 5500);
    Apartment twoRoomsBrooklyn = new Apartment(2, 38, 4200);
    Apartment fourAndKitchenBronx = new Apartment(3, 78, 2500);

    System.out.println( studioManhattan.larger(twoRoomsBrooklyn) );       // false
    System.out.println( fourAndKitchenBronx.larger(twoRoomsBrooklyn) );   // true
  
Exercise 87.2 is about Price difference
  * Implement the method public int priceDifference(Apartment otherApartment) that returns the absolute value of the price difference of 
    the Apartment object for which the method is called (this) and the apartment object given as parameter (otherApartment). 
    The price of an apartment is squareMeters * pricePerSquareMeter.

  * Example of the usage:

    Apartment studioManhattan = new Apartment(1, 16, 5500);
    Apartment twoRoomsBrooklyn = new Apartment(2, 38, 4200);
    Apartment fourAndKitchenBronx = new Apartment(3, 78, 2500);

    System.out.println( studioManhattan.priceDifference(twoRoomsBrooklyn) );        // 71600
    System.out.println( fourAndKitchenBronx.priceDifference(twoRoomsBrooklyn) );    // 35400
  
Exercise 87.3 is about more expensive than
  * Implement the method public boolean moreExpensiveThan(Apartment otherApartment) that returns true 
    if the Apartment-object for which the method is called (this) has a higher price than the apartment object given as parameter (otherApartment).

  * Example of the usage:

    Apartment studioManhattan = new Apartment(1, 16, 5500);
    Apartment twoRoomsBrooklyn = new Apartment(2, 38, 4200);
    Apartment fourAndKitchenBronx = new Apartment(3, 78, 2500);

    System.out.println( studioManhattan.moreExpensiveThan(twoRoomsBrooklyn) );       // false
    System.out.println( fourAndKitchenBronx.moreExpensiveThan(twoRoomsBrooklyn) );   // true
