Exercise 84 is about Overloaded counter and is divided into 2 part

Exercise 84.1 is about Multiple constructors
  * Make a class Counter that holds a number that can be decreased and increased. 
    The counter also has an optional check that prevents the counter from going below 0. The class has to have the following constructors:
    - public Counter(int startingValue, boolean check) creates a new counter with the given value. The check is on if the parameter given to check was true.
    - public Counter(int startingValue) creates a new counter with the given value. The check on the new counter should be off.
    - public Counter(boolean check) creates a new counter with the starting value 0. The check is on if the parameter given to check was true.
    - public Counter() creates a new counter with the starting value of 0 and with checking off.
    
  * and the following methods:
    - public int value() returns the current value of the counter
    - public void increase() increases the value of the counter by one
    - public void decrease() decreases the value of the counter by one, but not below 0 if the check is on
    
Exercise 84.2: Alternative methods
  * Create also a one parametered versions of the methods increase and decrease:
    - public void increase(int increaseAmount) increases the value by the amount of the parameter. 
      If the value of the parameter is negative, the value will not change.
    - public void decrease(int decreaseAmount) decreases the value of the counter by the amount given by the parameter, but not below 0 if the check is on. 
      If the value of the parameter is negative, the value of the counter will not change.
