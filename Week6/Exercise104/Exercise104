Exercise 104 is about Sorting and is divided into 5 part
  * Note: in this assignment you're supposed to sort the array yourself. You can't use the help of the Arrays.sort()-method or ArrayLists!

Exercise 104.1 is about Smallest
  * Implement a method smallest, which returns the smallest value in the array.

    The frame of the method is as follows:

    public static int smallest(int[] array) {
        // write the code here
    }
  
  * NOTE: You can't change the array that gets passed into the method!

  * The following code demonstrates the functionality of the method:

    int[] values = {6, 5, 8, 7, 11};
    System.out.println("smallest: " + smallest(values));
  
  * output
    smallest: 5
  
Exercise 104.2 is about The index of the smallest
  * Implement a method indexOfTheSmallest, which returns the index of the smallest value in the array 
   (the position of the value in the array, that is).

  * The frame of the method looks like this:

    public static int indexOfTheSmallest(int[] array) {
        // code goes here
    }
  
  * NOTE: You can't change the array that gets passed into the method as a parameter!

  * The following code demonstrates the functionality of the method:

    // indexes:   0  1  2  3  4
    int[] values = {6, 5, 8, 7, 11};
    System.out.println("Index of the smallest: " + indexOfTheSmallest(values));

  * output
    Index of the smallest: 1
  
  * The smallest value of the table is 2 and its index (its location) in the array is 1. 
    Remember that the numbering of an array begins from 0.

Exercise 104.3 is about Index of the smallest at the end of an array
  * Implement a method indexOfTheSmallestStartingFrom, which works just like the method of the previous assignment, 
    but only takes into consideration the end of an array starting from a certain index. 
    In addition to the array the method gets as parameter an index, from which the search for the smallest will be started.

  * The frame of the method is as follows:

    public static int indexOfTheSmallestStartingFrom(int[] array, int index) {
        // write the code here
    }
  
  * NOTE: You can't change the array that gets passed into the method as a parameter!

  * The following code demonstrates the functionality of the method:

    // indexes:    0  1  2  3   4
    int[] values = {-1, 6, 9, 8, 12};
    System.out.println(indexOfTheSmallestStartingFrom(values, 1));
    System.out.println(indexOfTheSmallestStartingFrom(values, 2));
    System.out.println(indexOfTheSmallestStartingFrom(values, 4));

  * output
    1
    3
    4
  
  * In the example, the first method call finds the index of the smallest value starting from index 1. 
    Starting from index 1 the smallest value is 6, and its index is 1. 
    Respectively the second method call looks for the index of the smallest value starting from index 2. 
    In this case the smallest value is 8 and its index is 3. 
    The last call starts from the last cell of the array, in this case there is no other cells so the smallets value is in index 4.

Exercise 104.4 is about Swapping values
  * Create a method swap, to which will be passed an array and two of its indexes. The method swaps the values in the indexes around.

  * The frame of the method looks like this:

    public static void swap(int[] array, int index1, int index2) {
        // code goes here
    }
  
  * The following showcases the functionality of the method. 
    In printing the array we'll use the Arrays.toString-method which formats the array into a string:

    int[] values = {3, 2, 5, 4, 8};

    System.out.println( Arrays.toString(values) );

    swap(values, 1, 0);
    System.out.println( Arrays.toString(values) );

    swap(values, 0, 3);
    System.out.println( Arrays.toString(values) );

  * output
    [3, 2, 5, 4, 8]
    [2, 3, 5, 4, 8]
    [4, 3, 5, 2, 8]
  
Exercise 104.5 is about Sorting
  * Now we've got a set of useful methods, with which we can implement a sorting algorithm known as selection sorting.

  * The idea of selection sorting is this:
    - Move the smallest number of the array to index 0.
    - Move the second smallest number to the index 1.
    - Move the third smallest number to the index 2.
    - and so forth

  * In other words:
  - Inspect the array starting from index 0. Swap the value in index 0 and the smallest value in the array starting from index 0.
  - Inspect the array starting from index 1. Swap the value in index 1 and the smallest value in the array starting from index 1.
  - Inspect the array starting from index 2. Swap the value in index 2 and the smallest value in the array starting from index 2.
  - and so forth

  * Implement the method sort, which is based on the idea above. The method ought to have a loop that goes through the indexes of the array. 
    The methods smallestIndexStartingFrom and swap are surely useful. 
    Also print the contents of the array before sorting and after each round to be able to make sure that the algorithm works correctly.

  * Body of the method:

    public static void sort(int[] array) {
    }
  
  * Test the functionality of the method at least with this example:

    int[] values = {8, 3, 7, 9, 1, 2, 4};
    sort(values);
  
  * The program should print the following. Notice that you're to print the content of the array after each swap!

  * output
    [8, 3, 7, 9, 1, 2, 4]
    [1, 3, 7, 9, 8, 2, 4]
    [1, 2, 7, 9, 8, 3, 4]
    [1, 2, 3, 9, 8, 7, 4]
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 7, 9]
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9]
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9]
